# My Portfolio

In this project, I used Nodejs and Expressjs to create a portfolio page. You can view the homepage with my latest projects, a short about me section which you can exapand and view more at `/about` page. Looking at the projects, you can click over any project to view more about that project, like: title of the project, a description, technologies used to develop that project, live demo and a github repo. At the bottom of the page, you'll see at least one image from that project.
Trying to enter pages that are not available, will trigger the page not found (404) render and an error.pug file to show more about the issue.
